Firstly I uploaded a normal bio file that gives the basic idea about me.
Today I uploaded the file in which I learned how to dispaly the images on the screen through the links and after that I replace those links with the small name to increase the code readability.
I update the file by adding the prices of product.
I add the tags name content and property also I add a css file that create the box around the list of items.
